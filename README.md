# Format JS vim

Simple (a.k.a. hack) bridge that calls out to [format-js-cli](https://github.com/gillesruppert/format-js-cli).

This formats JS and adds `require` and `import type` for flow that are used in
the file. See the [original source code](https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/tree/master/pkg/nuclide-format-js-base) in the nuclide repo.
